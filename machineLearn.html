        <h2>Model Feature Data: Economic Indicators</h2>
        <p>
          Identified on the <a href="index.html">Project Overview</a>, this project follows the work of Welch &amp; Goyal (2008)<sup>1</sup> and follow-on efforts by Wang
          et al. (2020)<sup>2</sup>.  Economic and financial feature data utilized by Welch and Goyal in their report (2008)<sup>1</sup> is publically available and 
          procured via .xlsx format from the office of Amit Goyal at <a href='http://www.hec.unil.ch/agoyal'>his personal site</a>.  The fourteen (14) economic features
          Welch and Goyal identified to have any potentially-significant effect for the prediction of returns are detailed below.  Each was collected monthly from January
          1990 to December 2019, relatively matching the commodity price data collected from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

          <h4>Economic Indicators for Model Creation:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Dividends (D12):</b> Dividends are twelve-month moving sums of dividends paid on the S&amp;P 500 index; data obtained from the S&amp;P Corporation.</li>
            <li><b>Earnings (E12):</b> Earnings are twelve-month moving sums of earnings on the S&amp;P 500 index. Data obtained from Robert Shiller’s website for the 
              period 1990 to June 2003. Earnings from June 2003 to 2020 are from Goyal estimates on interpolation of quarterly earnings provided by the S&amp;P Corporation.</li>
            <li><b>Book to Market Ratio (b/m):</b> the ratio of book value to market value for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For the months of March to December, 
              computed by dividing the book value at the end of previous year by the price at the end of the current month. For the months of January to February, this is
              computed by dividing the book value at the end of 2 years ago by the price at the end of the current month.</li>
            <li><b>Treasury Bills (tbl):</b>  T-bill rates from 1990 to 2020 are the 3-Month Treasury Bill, Secondary Market Rate.</li>
            <li><b>Corporate Bond Yields (AAA):</b> Yields on AAA-rated bonds for the period 1990 to 2020</li>
            <li><b>Corporate Bond Yields (BAA):</b> Yields on BAA-rated bonds for the period 1990 to 2020</li>
            <li><b>Long Term Yield (lty):</b> Long-term government bond yields for the period 1990 to 2020</li>
            <li><b>Net Equity Expansion (ntis):</b> the ratio of twelve-month moving sums of net issues by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)-listed stocks divided by the total 
              market capitalization of NYSE stocks. This dollar amount of net equity issuing activity (IPOs, SEOs, stock repurchases, less dividends) for NYSE listed stocks
              is computed from Center for Research in Security Prices data</li>
            <li><b>Risk-free Rate (Rfree):</b> The risk-free rate for the period 1990 to 2020 is the T-bill rate</li>
            <li><b>Inflation (infl):</b> the Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers) for the period 1990 to 2020 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, lagged by one 
              month to account for distribution lag.</li>
            <li><b>Long Term Rate of Return (ltr):</b> Long-term government bond returns for the period 1990 to 2020 are from Ibbotson’s Stocks, Bonds, Bills and 
              Inflation Yearbook.</li>
            <li><b>Corporate Bond Returns (corpr):</b> Long-term corporate bond returns for the period 1990 to 2020 are from Ibbotson’s Stocks, Bonds, Bills and 
              Inflation Yearbook.</li>
            <li><b>Stock Variance (svar):</b> Stock Variance is computed as sum of squared daily returns on S&amp;P 500. Daily returns from 1990 to 2020 are obtained 
              from CRSP.</li>
            <li><b>Stock Prices (SPvw):</b> S&amp;P 500 index prices from 1990 to 2020 from CRSP’s month-end values. Stock Returns are the continuously-compounded 
              returns on the S&amp;P 500 index.</li>

          Such information is only marginally helpful for understanding the data; rather, more important for modeling purposes, is <b>the normalized spread of the data</b>.
          Normalizing the data allows a simple, comprehensive view of the feature data and each feature's relationship to both the real price and each other feature;  
          <b>visualizing the spread</b>, via a <i>violin chart</i>, <b>or the trend</b>, via a <i>line chart</i>, without normalization would exacerbate or hide the 
          correlations between features, though the effect on model output should be negligible since proportional weighting in each model kernel would take into account
          absolute numerical spread of the data.  Just as in the Time-Series Section, <b>the determination of the aluminum RRN model will be showcased throughout 
          this section</b>, with all other models determined in the same way and reported below. <b>Illustrated below are the spread and trend of the economic feature and 
          aluminum price data</b>:

          <br><b>From the interactive trend plot above</b>, filtering out each feature (<i>by clicking on the feature label in the legend</i>) until only the normalized 
          aluminum price and the single feature selected remain, there are three features that may seem to show correlation with a change in aluminum pricing at any time:
          <b>Treasury bills rates, risk-free rate, and Stock variance</b>, seem to show, if not predictive, then correlational behavior with the aluminum price.  Each of 
          the rates seem to semi-directly correlate with the price (rates rising when the aluminum price rises, or falling when the price falls), while any sharp increase
          in the stock variance (associated with stock market shocks, such as the 2008 Recession), correlate with a sharp decline in the commodity price of aluminum.
        </p>
        <h3>Price and Factor Correlation</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Identifying trends is important</b> for understanding the relationship between economic factors and price, and how these relationships <i>should</i> be  
          mirrored in the architecture or kernel weighting of any machine learning model.  Identifying these trends visually, as attempted above, is difficult; however,
          <b>numerically identifying the correlation</b> between factors and price is a relatively simple task.  <b>Correlation</b> numerically represents the 
          interdeterpendence of two factors: a correlation of <b>'1'</b> identifies that the two factors are proportionally linked, rising or falling in perfect union;  
          correlation does <i>not</i> imply a causal link between factors, but does imply a shared relationship either directly or indirectly (such as sharing a common 
          cause).  A correlation of <b>'-1'</b> identifies that the two factors are inversely linked, with one rising when the other falls or vice-versa.  A correlation
          of <b>'0'</b> identifies that the two factors are completely independent of each, rising or falling randomly with respect to each other.

          A heat map showing the correlations between economic factors amongst themselves and with aluminum price is presented below:

      <div class="col-12">

          Shown in the chart above, the economic factors with the largest positive correlations between each other are highlighted in green, while those with largest negative 
          correlation are highlighted in red.  In this way, the correlations between <b>treasury bill rates</b>, <b>AAA and BAA-rated corporate bond yields</b>, <b>long-term 
          yield</b>, and <b>the risk-free rate</b> are shown to be the highest positively correlated (although, the correlation between risk-free rate and treasury bill rate
          was already established in the economic factor descriptions).  <i>Conversely</i>, the <b>earnings and dividends from the S&amp;P 500 index</b> had the largest 
          negative correlation to these same factors (the treasury bill rate, corporate bond yields, and risk-free rate). The correlations between any of the remaining factors 
          were moderate at best; <b>moderate or small correlation between model features is desirable</b>, since strongly correlated features generally take up processing
          resources without positively contributing to the model (hence, the method for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). <br><br>

          <b>Reviewing the correlation between any of the economic factors and the aluminum price</b> along the bottom row or last column of the correlation matrix (all correlation 
          matrices are symmetrical) shows <b>no factors with more than a moderate (|corr_value| < 0.6) correlation with aluminum price</b>.  The two factors most strongly
          correlated with price, both positively or negatively, respectively - either is generally good for modeling/prediction purposes, are <b>treasury bill rate</b> 
          (which, as described above is heavily correlated with risk-free rate, corporate bond yields, and long-term yield) and <b>dividends from the S&amp;P 500 index</b>
          (again, correlated, in turn, with S&amp;P index earnings). From their moderate correlation, these factors, employed in a machine learning model, may entail better 
          predictive capabilities for the model, or, of equal probability, the correlation between each factor and aluminum price may not sufficiently precede the price 
          trend in order to accurately predict the latter. <br><br>
          
          <i>Another way of illustrating this</i>, consider predicting rain from measured humidity: it's well known that as humidity rises to near 100%, the odds of the 
          weather subsequently raining are very high; humidity is a great predictor for rain.  The reverse relationship is less helpful: if it starts to rain, one could 
          correctly say that the humidity is probably very high, near 100%; however, it has likely already been very humid for some, and the rain/no rain dichotomy is not 
          helpful for predicting moderate shifts in humidity (say from 20% to 50%). <br><br>

          To ascertain whether trends in economic data precede accompanying trends in aluminum price data, a lag, or 1 through 5 months, was assigned to the aluminum price;
          <b>the correlations between each of new lagged price features and the economic and original aluminum price are presented below</b>:
        </p>
      </div><!-- /.col-12 -->

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p><br>
          <b>Reviewing the correlations between any of the economic factors and the lagged aluminum price</b> shows that most of the strongest correlated factors with 
          aluminum price diminished moderately with time, including the non-lagged aluminum price (the moderate drop in correlation with lagged price corresponds to 
          the autocorrelation function values determined in the Time Analysis Section of this report): treasury bill rate dropped from 0.4988 to 0.4575 along with all the 
          similarly-correlated factors, such as corporate yields and long-term yields. the S&amp;P index dividend returns showed <i>no drop</i> in correlation over time. 
          The <b>stock variance</b> was the only factor is appreciably rise in correlation, though even this rise is still stasticially insignificant, from -0.0576 to 
          -0.1948 at a lag of four months.

          For each model, any and all of the preceding economic features <i>may</i> be used (see Feature Selection below) in addition to the real price commodity data 
          for which the model is being derived; including the price data allows technical indicators such as those described by Wang et al. to be modeled in the RNN layer 
          weighting.  <b>It may be expected that model weighting, at least for simple linear regression techniques, corresponds with the correlations identified above</b>, 
          although model efficacy is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of features selected for model inclusion and feature correlations may be dubious indicators.
        </p>

        <h2>Feature Selection:</h2>
        <p>
          From the most basic economic perspective, the price of commodities are driven by the supply and demand of each commodity: scarcity and high demand generally
          drive price higher, while abundance and low demand drive price lower.  This is by no means the extent of the factors driving price, but when attempting to
          understand the relationship between prices and economic factors, it may help to understand the role on demand or supply of various economic factors both for
          individual commodities, but also for other sectors of the economy where relative scarcity (lack of supply and/or overabundance of demand) or abundance may 
          affect commodity prices.  <i>For instance</i>, as discussed in the Time Series Section, when inflation is low, investors seeking a large rate of return for 
          invested capital may invest outside of commodities markets, whereas the reverse may be true for periods of high inflation.  Greater investment leads to greater 
          prices. <br><br>

          <b>Previous autoregressive analysis</b> of commodity prices show that there is a strong correlation of the aluminum price month to month, resulting in a 
          <i>random walk model</i> for forecasting the aluminum price.  Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation also showed that the effect on a current month's 
          aluminum price is limited to the first previous month and no further back.  In investigating the effect of economic features on the commodity pricing,  
          <b>it is not immediately known whether delayed correlation responses from any particular feature significantly affect the commodity price</b>; for that reason, the 
          basis for the machine learning model that will be employed for this project is a <b>Recurring Neural Network (RNN) that collects price and economic feature 
          data from a 6-month window to predict price data out to 6 months</b>.  A 6-month window was chosen to ensure that any offset in the publication of some 
          economic feature data or the natural economic feedback of any other feature that would ultimately affect commodity price are incorporated into the model 
          (<i>e.g., according to Welch and Goyal in their paper, inflation data is only relreased in the following month from when it would otherwise affect pricing, 
          so the effect of inflation may on commodity pricing may be delayed; the weight factoring for the previous month should correspond for any delayed response</i>).
          <br><br></p>

        <h4>Simple Modeling Weights</h4>
        <p>
          To illustrate the effect of factor weighting on price forecasting, <b>consider two models as such</b>: the first model is the simplest machine learning 
          model possible, <b>a single neuron, with 15 inputs</b>, corresponding to the economic factor and aluminum price normalized values from one month.  The second 
          is also <b>a single neuron, but with <i>90</i> inputs</b>, corresponding to the economic factor and aluminum price normalized values from six months previous.
          Developing these two models, with too many variables as they may have, and reviewing the kernel (or <i>weight factors</i>) gives insight into the relationship 
          between each economic factor and aluminum price.  Consider the first model, a single neuron with 15 weights and 1 bias factor (<i>bias trends to zero with 
          normalized</i>); this model and the derived weights from the

          <br><b>Seen in the weights above</b>, there are multiple fairly significant features, including <b>earnings</b>, <b>corporate bond yeilds</b>, and 
          <b>long-term returns</b>, with normalizes weights great than 0.2; <i>however</i>, as was mentioned previously, many of these significant features are also
          moderately correlated.  In practice, <b>there are multiple potentially-significant features with weights that actually cancel to the two out</b>.  Consider 
          <i>AAA and BAA-rated corporate bonds</i>: shown in the correlation matrix, these two features are heavily positively correlated (rising and falling in tandem), 
          but in the simple model presented about, they have near-equal and opposite weighting.  What this means, in effect, is the two features cancel each other 
          out, and there would be no difference in the model simply weighting both as zero; it is a feature/bug of the optimization process that the model doesn't already 
          do this for correlated data. Based on the correlation of features, it is likely that <b>the long-term government (ltr) and corporate (corpr) bond yields</b>, 
          <b>the AAA and BAA-rated yields</b>, and the <b>dividends/earnings from the S&amp;P Index and Net Equity Expansion (ntis)</b> may all act to cancel each other 
          out, at least partially.

          In this regard, when selecting the correct RNN model and incorporated features, <b>multiple models exploring different combinations of economic features</b>
          will be necessary.

        <h2>Project Conclusions and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning model, specifically one tailored to time series data, such as the Recurring 
            Neural Network (RNN) model, for predicting commodity price fluctuations over a standard autoregressive model.  So far presented are the autoregressive models 
            and the feature and correlation data background that will be pivotal to developing the RNN models for comparison.  Due to time constraints, the descriptions 
            of these RNN models have yet to be incorporated into the presented material here; however, <b>the RNN models otherwise developed for predicting commodity 
            prices were found, due to overfitting with too many model variables and the inate random spread of the price data, as shown by autocorrelation analysis, to 
            not significantly improve upon the autoregressive models, random walk methods</b>. <br><br>

            <b>Follow-on efforts for this project</b> will explore the modeling metal commodity index funds, with the intent that index funds tend to vary less wildly with 
            specific market flunctuations (such as gluts in supply of a particular commodity), and so may be capable of more significant modeling.<br><br>

            <i>Speaking also for myself now, Rich Gude, the author: this project was a great summary project of many of the methods I've learned in my Time Series and 
            Machine Learning classes.  Being able to methodically illustrate out the time-series and machine learning model building process, including much of the 
            ancillary processes, such as principal component and autocorrelation analysis, was not only helpful as I had to refresh myself on these topics, but also, I was 
            able now to scribe these methods down for future use and explanation in my future endeavors.  While this project was very long (both in researching and trying 
            to get my graph illustrations to appear as just so), it was well worth while.</i>
