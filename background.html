          A brief summary of each metal commodity under analysis, discussing its function and importance in various modern industries and principal uses, are detailed below:</p>

        <p id='descrText'>With roughly one-third the density of steel and copper but sufficient toughness and strength for most commercial uses, <b>ALUMINUM</b> has become one of the most important and versatile metalic 
          commodites in a multitude of industries.  The low-eight, corrosion-resistant properties of aluminum is used in transportation industries for the frames of automobiles, aeroplanes, and marine vessels, 
          construction for construction frames, doors, and siding, and consumer goods, including a multitude of appliances, utensils, tools, and packaging. By quantity, it is the second-most produced and consumed 
          metal commodity after iron/steel.<br><br>
        
          Aluminum, in it's natural form, is often chemically bonded in bauxite formations (rock consisting of aluminum hydroxide minerals); for this reason, it is fairly resource-intensive to convert dried alumina 
          into pure aluminum metal.  Consequently, aluminum recycling forms a significant proportion of aluminum production; according to the United States Geologial Survey, in the year 2000, 36% of the US supply 
          of aluminum metal came from recycled scrap.

        <p id='descrText'><b>COPPER</b> is one of the oldest, industrially-used metal commodities on the planet, dating to its early incorporation into bronze armaments and tooling in the 2000s BCE.  Known today for its exceptional
          malleability (i.e., propensity to be shaped and bent) and thermal and electrical conductivity, copper is highly utilized in electrical generation and distribution, telecommunication, and electronic product 
          industries; these uses account for three-quarters of all copper consumption with building construction being the single largest market among its uses.  By quantity, copper is the third-largest produced metal commodity
          after only iron/steel and aluminum, and similarly to aluminum, copper recycling makes up a significant portion of the ongoing copper supply.

        <p id='descrText'>Similar to iron in its atomic structure and valence, <b>NICKEL</b> has many uses in alloying with iron in austenitic stainless steel applications; the vast majority of nickel consumption (upwards of 70%) is 
          utilized in the production of these stainless steels and other speciality alloys.  Large-constituent nickel alloys are known for their exceptional corrosion resistance, especially in high-temperature applications 
          such as those in the aerospace and energy generation industries (namely for turbine blades, discs, and housing).  Nickel is additionally used in catalyst, coinage, foundry products and plating, and, to a growing 
          extent, rechargeable battery applications.

      <div class="col-lg-9 col-7" style='padding: 6px 3px 3px 20px'>
        <p id='descrText'>Though naturally abundant, <b>IRON</b> is not normally found in its metallic form often.  For this reason, iron metal is processed from abundant iron ore deposits, generally consisting of iron oxide compounds.
          Metalic iron itself has few industrial resources, due to its low strength and corrosion resistance, so iron is alloyed with carbon, chromium, manganese, nickel, and other elements and processed in divergent manners 
          to produce forms of steels with varying degrees of fracture toughness, tensile strength (the last two generally being inversely proportional to each other), corrosion resistance, and a host of other desirable traits.
          <br><br>
          Steel is far and away the most produced metal commodity on the planet: in 2015, over 1.5 <i>billion</i> metric tons of steel were produced world-wide; for comparison, aluminum, the second most-produced metal commodity, 
          had less than 60 <i>million</i> metric tons produced during the same period (i.e., less than 4% of the produced tonnage of steel).  There are few industries that do not utilize steel in some form.

          alternative for corrosion-resistant stainless steel, as an alloy constituent in bronze, brass, and die-cast compounds, and in its rolled metallic form.  The remaining quarter of zinc consumption is in rubber, chemical,
          and agricultural industries.  By quantity, zinc is the fourth-largest produced metal commodity after iron/steel, aluminum, and copper.

        <p><b>Utilizing the infographic:</b> The default view of the infographic is a heat map of the output quantity of Aluminum in metric tons per year per country.  The default year is 2015, but the year value can be changed by dragging the 
          cursor at the horizontal scroll bar on the bottom of the world map for any commodity, and the specific commodity under review can be adjusted with the labeled buttons above the year scroll bar. <br><br>
          Mousing over individual countries will highlight the country and display the specific comoddity production output of that country.  The global output trend from 2011 to 2015 for any selected commodity is shown below the world map in the 
          line graph by default.  Clicking any specific country will show the country trend from 2011 to 2015 in the line graph, in lieu of the global trend.  The line chart showing total production of commodities can be changed to a bar chart 
          showing the change in production through each year from 2012 to 2015 by toggling the switch labeled with <i>'year change'</i> in the line chart legend.  Also within the legend, additional metal commodity trends can be compared to the

        <p><b>As can be seen in the above infographic and accompanying trend data</b>, over the period observed (2011 to 2015), the production output of each commodity rose continuously for a few commodities in a few 
          years: <b>Aluminum</b> and <b>copper</b> saw continuous production increase year over year, increasing 22.9% and 18.6%, respectively, over the period, with <b>steel</b> and <b>zinc</b> production following a similar trend until 2015 where each saw a decrease 
          in production to 2012 levels (still increasing 5.2% and 2.4%, respectively, on the whole over the period).  <b>Nickel</b> was the only commodity to see an overall drop in production from 2.34 million metric tons to 2.28, a 
          comparatively small drop of 2.6% of total production). <br><br> For each metal commodity, individual countries dominate the production output: <b>China</b> dominates the aluminum, steel, and zinc markets 
          especially for the former two, with roughly <i>10 times</i> the production output of the second-largest producer of each (the Russian Federation for aluminum and the United States for steel); in this way, 
          the aluminum and steel production from China represents <b>roughly 50% or more</b> of the global supply of either metal.  For comparison, Chile, the largest single producer of copper, represents 30% of 
          the global copper market, and the Philippines, the largest single producer of nickel, represents 25%.

          highlight the individual metal commodity data on the infograph.  It is important to recognize that the scale for the price axis (the left/Y axis) is <i>logarithmic</i>, 
          so the price flunctuations between more expensive commodities, such as nickel, that seemingly match price fluctuations of cheaper commodities, such as iron, may only do  
          so in relative perspective, not in absolute monetary values.  Toggling the switch for 'linear' in the legend will change the axis from a log to linear axis, accordingly,

          the Internal Monetary Fund (IMF), displayed here as a non-commercial, primary research activity.</i></small><br><br>

        <p><b>The logarithmic scale</b> presented in the graphic belies the large fluctuations in commodity metal pricing in during the previous three decades:
          From a relatively low level with stable fluctuations in the 1990s, there is a sharp spike in commodity prices (excluding iron ore) in the mid-2000s, ending
          in ~2008 with the global finincial crisis and "Great Recession" of 2008, followed by a modest recovery in the early 2010s and tailing off in the mid-2010s.  
          In the period from the commodity production data above (2011 to 2015), the price of each commodity trended down, despite, as previously noted, the production output 
          trend of all but one commodity (nickel) trending up.  These general trends agree with economic principle that as a supply (production) increases, prices tend to 
          decrease as a set demand of each commidity drives competing suppliers to undercut each other.
