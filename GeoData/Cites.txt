The GeoData comes from 2015, XLS-Format reports from The USGS National Minerals Information Center
for the following metals:
	Iron and Steel	(https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/iron-and-steel-statistics-and-information)
	Nickel		(https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/nickel-statistics-and-information)
	Copper		(https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/copper-statistics-and-information)
	Zinc		(https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/zinc-statistics-and-information)
	Aluminum	(https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/aluminum-statistics-and-information)

For ease raw data was manipulated outside of Python in Microsoft Excel.  The following sheets were
selected and ammended from each XLS file:

	Aluminum
	- Sheet 'T13', footnote annotations were dropped
	- Values are converted 1000 metric tons to metric tons

	Copper
	- Sheet 'T20', footnote annotations were dropped
	- Values show 'concentrate' and 'leaching/electrowon' totals
	- Values are in metric tons

	Iron
	- Sheet 'T10', footnote annotations were dropped
	- Values are converted 1000 metric tons to metric tons

	Nickel
	- Sheet 'T10', footnote annotations were dropped
	- Values show all ore (sulfide or laterite) totals
	- Values are in metric tons

	Zinc
	- Sheet 'T9', footnote annotations were dropped
	- Values are in metric tons
